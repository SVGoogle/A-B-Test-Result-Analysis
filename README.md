# A/B test results
In this project the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website are analysed. Main goal of the project is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

The statistical methods in this project include: hypothesis testing, bootstrapping sample distribution, estimating z-score, p-values and confidence intervals and fitting the data to a logistic regression model.
